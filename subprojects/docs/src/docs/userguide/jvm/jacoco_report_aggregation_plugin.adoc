[[jacoco_report_aggregation_plugin]]
= The JaCoCo Report Aggregation Plugin

The JaCoCo Report Aggregation plugin (plugin id: `jacoco-report-aggregation`) provides the ability to aggregate the results of multiple JaCoCo code coverage reports (potentially spanning multiple Gradle projects) into a single HTML report.  The binary data backing the coverage reports are produced by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task invocations; see more at the <<jacoco_plugin#jacoco_plugin,JaCoCo Plugin>> chapter.

The plugin adds configurations and artifact views which collect variants exposed by the JaCoCo Plugin. More details TBD

== Usage

There are two ways to collect code coverage across multiple subprojects:

1. From the distribution's project, such as an Android application or WAR subproject -> link:../samples/sample_jvm_multi_project_with_code_coverage_distribution.html[distribution sample]
2. Using a standalone project to specify subprojects -> link:../samples/sample_jvm_multi_project_with_code_coverage_standalone.html[standalone sample]

Details TBD
